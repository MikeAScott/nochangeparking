!2 Tests
Our Test Context is:
!|NoChangeParking.FitFixtures.TheCallCentre|
!include .FixtureImport

!3 A driver who has not registered details will not have any default Vehicle or CC number stored.
Given that our list of registered drivers does not include new driver John,
!|Setup Registered Drivers|
|Driver|Default Vehicle|Default Credit Card|
|Jane|Car5|CC2|


When John calls,
Check that John's default values are blank

|New Call from Driver|John|
|check|Vehicle||
|check|Credit Card||

!3 Registering details set these as the default for this driver's number.
When the driver registers Car1 and CCNum1
Check that the driver's default values are Car1 and CCNum1
|New Call from Driver|John|
|Register Vehicle|Car1|
|Register Credit Card|CCNum1|
|check|Vehicle|Car1|
|check|Credit Card|CCNum1|

|Registered Drivers|
|Id|Default Vehicle|Default Credit Card|
|Jane|Car5|CC2|
|John|Car1|CCNum1|

!3 When a previously registered driver calls, their registered details will be used as the defaults
Given two drivers John and Jane with registered details (as follows),

|Setup Registered Drivers|
|Driver|Default Vehicle|Default Credit Card|
|Jane|Car2|CCNum2|
|John|Car1|CCNum1|

When John makes a call to us,
Check that John's default values (Car1 and CCNum1) are retrieved

|New Call from Driver|John|
|check|Vehicle|Car1|
|check|Credit Card|CCNum1|


When Jane makes a call to us,
Check that Jane's default values (Car2 and CCNum2) are retrieved

|New Call from Driver|Jane|
|check|Vehicle|Car2|
|check|Credit Card|CCNum2|

When an unregistered driver makes a call to us,
Check that no default values are retrieved

|New Call from Driver|Peter|
