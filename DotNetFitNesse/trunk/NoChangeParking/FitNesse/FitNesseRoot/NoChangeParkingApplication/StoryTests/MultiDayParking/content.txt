As a: Driver
I want to: phone up and pay for multiple days parking
So that:  I don't need to make several calls for long stays

Need to:
 * specify number of days when calling
 * reject if more than 7 days
 * calculate amount to pay.  e.g. 

|Check total cost based on |£5.50|daily rate|
|Duration | Payment Amount?|
|1|£5.50|
|2|£11.00|
|7|£38.50|
|8|error|

!|New call from driver|	John |
|Pay for Vehicle|Car66|With Credit Card|ValidCardNumber1|
|check|Paid for Days|1|
|check|Price|£5.00|

!2 When a driver pays for 2 days charge is £10.00
