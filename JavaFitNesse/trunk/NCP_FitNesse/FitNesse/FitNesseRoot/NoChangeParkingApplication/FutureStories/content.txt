!2 Iteration 3: Drivers with more than one Vehicle
!3 StoryTests.RegisterMultipleVehicles
Many drivers use more than one car regularly. We should let them register all of them, rather than just one default.
!3 StoryTests.DriverCanParkDifferentVehicle
Once they have registered multiple vehicles, it should be easy to choose which one to use when paying for parking.

!2 Iteration 4: Stories for Business expansion
!3 StoryTests.MultipleParkingLocations
We could sell this service to other carparks. Need a way of identifying which car park is being paid for. (This is probably an Epic rather than a story.) 
!3 StoryTests.EditParkingRates
Other car parks might not have flat parking rates. Need to set up rate tables.
-----
!2 Iteration 5: Parking for more than one day
!3 StoryTests.MultiDayParking
Some drivers want to pay for consecutive days parking with just one call, instead of calling each day.
!3 StoryTests.ExtendParking
If a driver has paid for parking that is still active, they should be able to extend this by one or more days
