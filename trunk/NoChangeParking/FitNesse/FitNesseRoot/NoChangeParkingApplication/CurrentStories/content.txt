!1 In Progress Stories
!2 These are the stories still to be completed in the CurrentIteration

Stories are referenced on this page (and removed from FutureStories) when their iteration starts.

To check the progress of story completion for this iteration, run the Suite on the CurrentIteration page.
If you test the stories on this page (press the "Suite" button) we expect the acceptance tests to fail (red) or throw exceptions (yellow).
When a story is complete and all the tests pass (green), remove it from this page and reference it on CompletedStories.
