!1 An Inspector Can Check A Vehicle

!2 Scenario
 * As A: Parking Inspector
 * I Want To: Check whether or not a given vehicle in the car park has paid 
 * So That: We can issue tickets for illegally parked cars.

!2 Tests
Our test context is:
!|NoChangeParking.FitFixtures.TheCallCentre|
!include -c .FixtureImport
!2 Business Rules
Given that these vehicles have paid:
!|Setup Payments|
|Vehicle|
|Car1|
|Car2|


An Inspector can check that individual vehicles are paid for or not.
If a car is on the list then the system returns true when checking the Registration number. 
For example:
!|Vehicle | Car2 |Has Paid|
|Vehicle | Carx |Has Not Paid|

If we setup a different payments list any previous list is cleared
!|Setup Payments|
|Vehicle|
|Car3|

!|Vehicle | Car1 |Has Not Paid|

|Vehicle | Car2 |Has Not Paid|

|Vehicle | Car3 |Has Paid|
